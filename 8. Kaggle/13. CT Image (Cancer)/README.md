# Overview

The dataset is designed to allow for different methods to be tested for examining the trends in CT image data associated with using contrast and patient age. The basic idea is to identify image textures, statistical patterns and features correlating strongly with these traits and possibly build simple tools for automatically classifying these images when they have been misclassified (or finding outliers which could be suspicious cases, bad measurements, or poorly calibrated machines)

# Data

The data are a tiny subset of images from the cancer imaging archive. They consist of the middle slice of all CT images taken where valid age, modality, and contrast tags could be found. This results in 475 series from 69 different patients.
